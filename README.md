# Study Planner

This simple program was created to help manage study time. It was designed to encourage a method called 'Interval Studying' (as opposed to 'Cramming'). 

The student can:
* add new courses,
* after a topic is studied in class, the topic can be added and the frequency at which it should be revised can be specified. For example, a frequency 1 2 4 7 10 would encourage the student to revise the topic 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 days after it was studied in class.
* view the list of topics that should be revised, on a specific date.
